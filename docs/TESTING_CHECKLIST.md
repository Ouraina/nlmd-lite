# Testing Checklist for Enterprise Features

## Pre-Migration Testing

### Database Schema Validation
- [ ] All table definitions are syntactically correct
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are properly defined
- [ ] Check constraints are validated with test data
- [ ] Unique constraints prevent duplicate data
- [ ] Default values are appropriate and functional

### Data Integrity Testing
- [ ] Insert valid records into all new tables
- [ ] Test foreign key constraint enforcement
- [ ] Verify cascade delete behavior
- [ ] Test check constraint violations
- [ ] Validate unique constraint enforcement

### Performance Baseline
- [ ] Measure current query performance
- [ ] Document current database size
- [ ] Record connection pool usage
- [ ] Benchmark critical user workflows
- [ ] Establish performance thresholds

## Post-Migration Testing

### Functional Testing
- [ ] AI recommendation generation works
- [ ] User preferences save and load correctly
- [ ] Team creation and management functions
- [ ] Comment system operates properly
- [ ] Follow/unfollow functionality works
- [ ] Analytics data collection functions

### Security Testing
- [ ] RLS policies enforce user isolation
- [ ] Team permissions work correctly
- [ ] Admin-only access is restricted
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts fail
- [ ] Data leakage between users prevented

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Query execution times within thresholds
- [ ] Database connection pool stable
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] CPU utilization acceptable
- [ ] Response times under load

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Frontend components load correctly
- [ ] API endpoints return expected data
- [ ] Real-time updates function properly
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] User workflows complete successfully

## User Acceptance Testing

### Core Workflows
- [ ] User can discover and import notebooks
- [ ] AI recommendations appear and function
- [ ] Team collaboration features work
- [ ] Analytics dashboards display data
- [ ] User preferences persist correctly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Large team management (100+ members)
- [ ] High-volume recommendation generation
- [ ] Concurrent user interactions
- [ ] Network interruption recovery
- [ ] Browser compatibility across platforms

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works throughout
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verified
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [ ] Focus management is logical
- [ ] ARIA labels are present and correct

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Real-time Monitoring
- [ ] Database performance metrics

- [ ] Security event logging
- [ ] Resource utilization tracking

### Alert Configuration
- [ ] Performance degradation alerts
- [ ] Error rate threshold alerts
- [ ] Security incident notifications
- [ ] Resource exhaustion warnings
- [ ] User experience impact alerts

## Rollback Testing

### Rollback Procedures
- [ ] Database rollback scripts tested
- [ ] Application rollback procedures verified
- [ ] Data integrity after rollback confirmed
- [ ] User access restored properly
- [ ] Performance returns to baseline

### Recovery Testing
- [ ] Backup restoration procedures
- [ ] Data consistency after recovery
- [ ] Application functionality post-recovery
- [ ] User notification procedures
- [ ] Incident response protocols
